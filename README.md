# CropResidueNet
This repository showcases my work as a Research Assistant in the Geology Department at Indiana University, where I developed and optimized machine learning models to analyze remote sensing, spectral reflectance, and environmental datasets.
This actually is a project that develop a deep neural network model to predict fractional crop residue cover (fR) from multispectral reflectance and vegetation indices. Using a Keras/TensorFlow architecture with configurable learning rate and optimizer, the model learns nonlinear relationships between spectral features and residue cover, helping estimate soil conservation metrics from remote sensing data. It supports Colab-based execution for easy dataset upload, training, and evaluation, producing reproducible results with built-in scaling, callbacks, and performance visualization.
